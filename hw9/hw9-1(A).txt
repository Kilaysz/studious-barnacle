1. floatToBinary Function: 
â€“ The input for this function is a float number (num).
- Treating the float's memory as an unsigned int, it constructs an integer pointer, ptr, and assigns it the address of the num variable.
The original float value is printed, and a loop is then used to go over each bit of the unsigned int representation.
- By shifting the bits of the pointer value (*ptr) to the right (>>) and extracting the least significant bit using a bitwise AND operation (&) with 1, the loop outputs each bit.
- The loop moves from right to left, from the most to the least important bit.
- The binary representation of the float number is the end result.

2. doubleToBinary Function:
- Similar to floatToBinary but works with double precision floating-point numbers.
- It uses an unsigned long long pointer to reinterpret the memory of the double as that of an unsigned long long.
- The loop iterates over each bit of the unsigned long long representation, printing the binary representation of the double number.

3. binaryToFloat Function:
- This function takes a 32-bit binary pattern (provided as a string binary) as input.
- It converts the binary pattern to an unsigned int by iterating over each character in the string and building the integer using bitwise left shifts (<<) and bitwise OR (|) operations.
- It then uses a float pointer to reinterpret the memory of the unsigned int as that of a float.
- The result is printed as the value of the original float number corresponding to the given binary pattern.

4. binaryToDouble Function:
- Similar to binaryToFloat but works with 64-bit binary patterns and double precision floating-point numbers.
- It uses an unsigned long long variable to store the bits, and the process of conversion is the same as in binaryToFloat.
- It then uses a double pointer to reinterpret the memory of the unsigned long long as that of a double.
- The result is printed as the value of the original double number corresponding to the given binary pattern.

5. Main function
- Presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose between float to binary, double to binary, binary to float, or binary to double conversions.
- Reads the user's choice and performs the corresponding operation by calling the respective function.
- Handles user input for float/double values or binary patterns.
- Uses a switch statement to execute the chosen operation.
- Provides an error message for an invalid choice.
